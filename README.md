# Tenzies Game

Tenzies is a simple and exciting dice game implemented in React.js. The goal of the game is to roll the dice and strategically choose which ones to hold, with the aim of getting all the dice to display the same number. You win when you achieve this and can keep track of your progress with a roll counter.

## How to Play

1. Start the game, and it will display a set of random dice numbered from 1 to 6.

2. You can click on the dice you want to hold, effectively freezing their values. The dice you don't hold will be re-rolled in the next turn.

3. Keep rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll" button. Unheld dice will be re-rolled, and you can choose to hold or release dice as needed.

4. Continue rolling and holding dice until all the dice display the same number.

5. When you achieve a winning combination where all the dice show the same number and are held, you win the game!

## Roll Tracker

The game keeps track of the number of rolls you've made. You can see this information displayed on the screen, which helps you keep score and track your progress.
